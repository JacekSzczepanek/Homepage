# Hello everyone

I would like to introduce my first website project.
I'm just at the beginning of learning web technologies.

It is a simple website based on HTML, CSS and JS
On the website you can learn about the basic terms in the world of whiskey

In addition, the website has been prepared in two themes, dark and light, which can be changed by clicking the button

The website uses technologies and conventions:
- HTML
- CSS
- JS
- BEM
- camelCase
